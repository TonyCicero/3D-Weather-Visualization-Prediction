# WeatherAI
AI Weather Research Project written in Python and Unity

Background: I original created this project to experiment with predicting weather using python. After writing a python script to download and display data on a 2d map (using matplotlib), I decided expand on the current project in COSC482 (Computer Graphics). Dan Weitman and I are working on display weather data in 3D using unity

Goal: Gather current data from https://openweathermap.org. Visualize Data in 3d using Unity. Use AI to make predictions on future weather. Present Data.

Current Progress: Gathers data from https://openweathermap.org/ and stores it in a sqlite database. Can present and output data as an image format. Generate Raster images using real-world, and interpolated data. Project raster images onto 3d surfaces
